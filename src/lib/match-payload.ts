// Simulation JSON Event Bridge.
// After a match completes, the engine's per-player state is read into a
// structured data payload. The v7.0/v7.1 engine tracks goals, assists and
// goalkeeper stats (saves, goals conceded, clean sheets) DIRECTLY during the
// match loop, so this bridge simply reads those values — no extra RNG draws,
// preserving the engine's deterministic event sequence. The state manager
// intercepts this payload to update league statistics (Golden Boot, Assist
// Leaders, Golden Glove), apply disciplinary counts and roll injuries.

// ---------------- 1. Generate the question set ----------------
const QUESTIONS_RULES = `
You are the Eden League press corps preparing a short press conference. Generate sharp, specific reporter questions a manager would actually face — grounded ONLY in the DATA block (standings, recent results, key players, injuries, contracts, rivals). Vary the angle: form, tactics, a specific player, a rival, a fixture, dressing-room mood.

TONE BALANCE (CRITICAL): Mix POSITIVE and NEGATIVE angles evenly. Roughly half the questions should highlight successes, strengths, opportunities, or praise (wins, good form, rising stars, title chances, strong performances). The other half may address challenges, setbacks, or pressure points. Do NOT default to hostile or bearish framing — the press corps includes supporters and neutrals, not just critics.

MANAGER NAME ACCURACY (CRITICAL): Always use the CURRENT MANAGER name from the "CURRENT REALITY" section of the brief. Previous manager names in press archive quotes are PAST HISTORY — never use them as if they are the current manager. If the brief shows a manager named "Alex" but archive quotes refer to "Jordan", you MUST use "Alex" as the current speaker.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Never invent stats, players, clubs, scores, or league events not present in the DATA.
- Each question is one or two sentences, ending with a question mark.
- Address the manager naturally using their CURRENT name from the CURRENT REALITY section.
- For PRE-MATCH context, mix excitement about the matchup with tactical questions.
- For POST-MATCH context, balance praise for what went well with analysis of challenges.
- For GENERAL context, range across the season, mixing bullish and bearish topics.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Respond with ONLY a JSON array of strings, no prose, no markdown.
- Each string is one question. Produce the requested number of questions.

- Do NOT repeat or paraphrase any question already asked in this conference (see PRIOR EXCHANGES below). Do NOT re-ask topics the manager has already answered on-record in the RECENT PRESS QUOTES archive within the brief — if a player's contract, an injury, a tactical change, or a feud has been discussed recently, MOVE ON unless brand-new information warrants a follow-up.
- If the manager's previous answer in this conference contained a quotable claim, contradiction, taunt, or dodge, FOLLOW UP on it directly — quote or reference their exact words.
- Vary the angle across the conference: form, tactics, a specific player, a rival, the next fixture, dressing-room mood.

const SCORE_RULES = `
You are an analyst rating the on-record press-conference response of a club manager. Read their answer carefully and decide what real-world EFFECT it would have on team morale, individual player morale, and the manager's RELATIONSHIP with other clubs' managers — purely from the words said.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- ONLY reference teams, managers, and players present in the VALID lists provided. If the manager spoke about no one specific, return an empty targets array.
- BE DECISIVE. Bland/generic answers get ±0 to ±2. Pointed, memorable, in-character answers should MOVE things — do not default everything to ±1. Use the full range.
- A manager talking about THEIR OWN team / player carries more weight than talking about a rival's.
- Praise → positive deltas. Criticism / blame / dismissal → negative deltas. Neutral analysis → no target.
- Insulting another manager personally → strongly negative relationDelta with that manager's team. Public praise → strongly positive.
- Self-talk or generic banter has NO targets.
- "respectDelta" is -15..+15 and reflects how the press and public judge THIS answer. USE THE FULL RANGE — do not cluster around ±1:
    * 0 = forgettable filler,
    * ±1..±2 = mildly on/off-key,
    * ±3..±5 = clearly sharp OR clearly weak (most in-character answers land here or higher),
    * ±6..±9 = standout — visionary leadership speech / damning gaffe / brutal put-down / genuine class,
    * ±10..±15 = CAREER-DEFINING — reserved for the extremes: shameless self-promotion, throwing your own stars under the bus, viciously insulting a rival manager by name, blaming refs for a loss, refusing to answer, profanity, an inspiring rally cry, principled stand, or genuinely brilliant wit. Do NOT cap at ±3 or ±5 when the answer truly earns more; if it's the kind of quote that would lead a sports news cycle, score it ±10 or higher.
- If the answer is genuinely hateful/insulting/reckless, the AI should go NEGATIVE 10+. If it's genuinely inspiring/masterful, POSITIVE 10+. Err toward volatility over safety.
- "harshness" is 0..1 — 0 = sugary, 0.5 = balanced, 1 = scathing.

const AI_PRESS_RULES = `
You are simulating a full weekly press conference for an AI-controlled Eden League manager. You will play BOTH the reporter (asking questions) and the manager (answering in character).

TONE BALANCE (CRITICAL): Mix POSITIVE and NEGATIVE questions evenly across the conference. Some questions should highlight successes, strengths, praise-worthy moments, or exciting opportunities. Others may address challenges. The press corps is not hostile — they include supporters and fair-minded journalists.

MANAGER NAME ACCURACY (CRITICAL): Always use the CURRENT MANAGER name from the "CURRENT REALITY" section of the brief. Previous manager names in press archive quotes are PAST HISTORY.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Use ONLY facts present in the DATA / BRIEF block, the VALID lists, and prior on-record press quotes shown in the brief.
- Generate 1 to 3 Q&A pairs total. Keep it lean (this is a routine weekly press, not a championship event). Default to 2 unless there is a clearly newsworthy storyline that justifies a third question.
- The manager's voice MUST match their stated personality. Combative personalities push back, jab, or rant; warm personalities praise; quiet personalities stay terse. They are a real person — they can taunt rivals, defend their players, complain about the schedule, or take a shot at another club's manager if it fits their character and recent events.
- Each answer is 1-3 sentences, conversational, plausible from a real manager.
- Score the WHOLE conference's effect via the targets array — same shape as a user press conference. Reserve big magnitudes for genuinely pointed answers.
